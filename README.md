# Parametric Equalizer 100

Still in development, but essentially a simple parametric EQ like those found
on audio consoles: 3 bands with Gain, Q, Freq parameters, a low pass filter and 
a high pass filter. 

As it stands now the GUI still needs improvement, and there is some audible
glitches when moving the knobs. Use in discretion, the current version is not
stable.
